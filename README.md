# JavaScript Assignment - Word Guess Game

### Overview

In this assignment, we were asked to create a computer game: Word Guess. This app will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code.

### My Theme

Animations that most 80's and 90's kids probably have watched! If not I'm sure they've heard of it at least one of them!

And few movies written by Hayao Miyazaki. Like "Spirited Away" hint.. hint..

### How It Works

You get 10 guesses before you loss the game. 

If you couldn't guess the right name, it will alert you what was the right answer. Press any keys to start another game. 

If you guessed right, the background image is going to change to match the animation name.

Good Luck and Please Enjoy the Game!
